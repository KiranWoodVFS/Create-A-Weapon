# Create-A-Weapon

**PG29 Unity 1 - Create a Weapon Name**

Date: 2025-11-15

## About the Project

This project is to create a simple gun in Unity.

### What I did:
I took the base unity project we had worked on in class and changed the way the gun works.
The left click now is shotgun-like with a smaller lifespan. These bullets can also bounce off walls.
The right click shoots an explosive gun that explodes on impact. If a target is within the explosion it gets hit as well.

## How To Use

**Step 1:** Make sure to have Unity installed. Version 6000.0.58f2.

**Step 2:** Add project from the repository, or by cloning the repository to your desktop.

**Step 3:** Open the project.

## Extra things to improve

This is one of my first projects using unity so there is a lot of room for improvement and learning. I think I could have split more of my code into different scripts and I'm sure there are more efficient ways I could have accomplished the same goal.
